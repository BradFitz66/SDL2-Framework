# SDL2 Framework

A basic SDL2 framework. Currently a proof-of-concept. Has some basic texture and ImGui rendering.

Might be a PITA to use on your own machine. CMake will need to point to wherever SDL2 is installed on your system. Windows only? (I'm pretty new to C++ and even newer to "manual" build systems like cmake etc).

compile_flags.txt is for CoC on neovim so it knows what the include paths are. This should point to wherever the include directory are on your machine for SDL2/SDL2_image etc


# Why?

I need to have some examples of my proficency in C++ on my portfolio website. Making my own game framework using SDL2 and then probably also a small game using my own game framework is the best thing I can think of. I chose this over making something in Unreal Engine for a few reasons:

* I feels it shows a wider range of knowledge with certain C++ concepts than it would with UE
* I can also learn build systems like CMake while doing this
